# Recipe Sharing Platform GraphQL TypeScript

This is a TypeScript-based GraphQL API for a recipe sharing platform. It allows users to query for recipes, search recipes by ingredients, and also enables them to submit their own recipes.

Develop a GraphQL API for a recipe sharing platform. Users can query for recipes, search by ingredients, and submit their own recipes.

## Features

- **Query recipes**: Users can query for recipes available on the platform.
- **Search by ingredients**: Users can search for recipes based on the ingredients they have.
- **Submit recipes**: Authenticated users can submit their own recipes to share with the community.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The entire API is written in TypeScript to provide a strongly-typed development experience.
- **GraphQL**: The API is built using GraphQL to provide efficient and flexible data retrieval capabilities.
- **Node.js**: The API runs on Node.js to handle HTTP requests and serve the GraphQL endpoint.
- **Express**: Express.js is used as the web server framework to handle incoming HTTP requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB or any other database of choice can be used to store recipes and user data.

## Getting Started

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/RecipeSharingGraphQL
