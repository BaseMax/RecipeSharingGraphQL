# Recipe Sharing Platform GraphQL TypeScript

This is a TypeScript-based GraphQL API for a recipe sharing platform. It allows users to query for recipes, search recipes by ingredients, and also enables them to submit their own recipes.

Developed a **GraphQL API** for a recipe sharing platform. Users can query for recipes, search by ingredients, and submit their own recipes.

## Features

- **Query recipes**: Users can query for recipes available on the platform.
- **Search by ingredients**: Users can search for recipes based on the ingredients they have.
- **Submit recipes**: Authenticated users can submit their own recipes to share with the community.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The entire API is written in TypeScript to provide a strongly-typed development experience.
- **GraphQL**: The API is built using GraphQL to provide efficient and flexible data retrieval capabilities.
- **Node.js**: The API runs on Node.js to handle HTTP requests and serve the GraphQL endpoint.
- **Nestjs**: a popular open-source, back-end framework for Node. js and TypeScript-based, server-side applications.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used in order to get better performance due to tree structure like data.

## Getting Started

- Node.js (version v18.13.0 or higher)
- NPM (9.2.0)
